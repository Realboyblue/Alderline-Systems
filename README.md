# Alderline Systems - Static Site

This is a simple, fast static site designed for Netlify (forms included).

## Deploy (Netlify)
1. Put these files in a GitHub repo.
2. In Netlify: New site from Git -> pick repo.
3. Build command: (none) / leave blank
4. Publish directory: .
5. Deploy.

## Netlify Forms
The contact form is a Netlify form ("consult"). After your first deploy, submit the form once so it appears in Netlify > Forms.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` to change services, wording, and contact options.
- Swap the favicon in `assets/img/favicon.svg` if you want.
- Remove Google Fonts links in `index.html` if you want zero external calls.
